DinoCalculator Release 1v0


Hardware Version History

1.0 2012-12-31 - JRB: Prototype with Arduino Pro Mini (5V/16MHz)

Software Version History

1.0 2012-12-31 - JRB: RELEASE VERSION. Changed keypad matrix to match 
the layout I printed on the keypad sticker. Added blinkLEDs() to show 
activity when calculator is first powered ON. Commented out Serial 
commands and printInfo(), program size went from ~12,000 bytes to 
9,868 bytes.

0.5 2012-12-22 - JRB: Changed x,y,z,z2 from integers to floating
for "real" number calculations. Since floating point math is not 
completly exact http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Float I added code 
to check that the absolute value of the difference between the 
calculated answer and the entered answer is less than some small 
number. Reformated text layout for printing.

0.4c 2012-12-22 - JRB: WORKING VERSION of adding and subtracting
whole numbers only. Negative number adding and subtracting is also 
supported. Minus key can be used for negative numbers now, not just 
subtraction. (ie, can now enter "-3 + -5 = -8")

0.4b 2012-12-21 - JRB: Added condition to prevent "?" from giving
false "correct"

0.4 2012-12-19 - JRB: Added more information to program
description. Added comparison of user entered answer to calculated answer. 
Added Green and Red LED code for correct and wrong answer results. Changed 
code to allow negative number answers.

0.3 2012-12-18 - JRB: Corrected minor string issue with equal sign attaching 
to stringOne after calculation. Cleaned up serial commands for debugging.

0.2 2012-12-17 - JRB: Worked on code to add multi-digit numbers
instead of single digit numbers by doing conversion of strings to integers.

0.1 2012-12-17 - JRB: Got Code working to read key presses of membrane 4x4 keypad. 
Serial print commands added for debugging and will be commented out when code is stable.
