Summary:
This is a clone of a toy I had when younger.  It was a calculator 
that did not have a LCD display but instead had an owl sticker on
the front with two LED lights, one green and one red.  You would 
enter a math problem on the button keypad with what you thought 
the correct answer was, for example, 12 + 12 = 24, and then press 
the "?" key.  If your answer was right the green LED would light 
up, if your answer was wrong, the red LED would light up.

I believe this will be a great way for my preschool son to check 
his simple arithmetic without having a calculator just give him 
the answer.

For now the objective is to create a calculator capable of just 
adding and subtracting.

Future objectives (not in any particular order) will be to: 

1) replace the Arduino Pro Mini board with a custom made PCB and
   reduce parts to a minimum
   
2) add multiplication and division to the calculator's 
   capabilities.  
   
3) develop a custom keypad (maybe using tactile buttons and caps,
   or making my own "membrane" type keypad, or exploring "conductive"
   type buttons)

4) add sound for errors or beep whenever custom keypad button is 
   pressed
   
5) develop code so that it could also be used for a "math" type 
   game for multiple players.  For example, Display a math
   problem and contestants enter answer on their keypads. 
   If right move away from some peril (like a chomping 
   dinosaur) and if wrong move closer to peril.  Loser is the one 
   that gets eaten (chomp,chomp,chomp).

6) Make circuit low-power for longer battery life and replace the 9V 
   battery with two NiMH AA batteries.

7) Add a recharging circuit to recharge the two NiMH AA batteries 
   from USB.
