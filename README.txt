Summary:
When I was younger I had a calculator that did not have a LCD 
display but instead had an owl sticker on the front with two LED 
lights, one green and one red.  You would enter a math problem on 
the button keypad and then enter what you thought the correct answer 
was, for example, 12 + 12 = 24, and then press the "?" key.  
If your answer was right the green LED would light up, if your 
answer was wrong, the red LED would light up.

This is my salute to that toy of ages gone by as well as 
a great way for my preschool son to check his simple arithmetic 
without having a calculator just give him the answer.

I don't know how the original was built but I plan on starting
with an Arduino Pro Mini as the brain and once I can get most 
of the major bugs worked out I will then move on to just a 
Atmega328p on a custom PCB with low power usage added in.

For now the objective is to create a calculator capable of just adding and subtracting.

Future objectives (not in any particular order) will be to:

1) replace the Arduino Pro Mini board with a custom made PCB and reduce parts to a minimum

2) add multiplication and division to the calculator's capabilities.

3) develop a custom keypad (maybe using tactile buttons and caps, or making my own "membrane" type keypad, or exploring "conductive" type buttons)

4) add sound for errors or beep whenever custom keypad button is pressed

5) develop code so that it could also be used for a "math" type game for multiple players. For example, Display a math problem and contestants enter answer on their keypads. If right move away from some peril (like a chomping dinosaur) and if wrong move closer to peril. Loser is the one that gets eaten (chomp,chomp,chomp).

6) Make circuit low-power for longer battery life and replace the 9V battery with two NiMH AA batteries.

7) Add a recharging circuit to recharge the two NiMH AA batteries from USB.
