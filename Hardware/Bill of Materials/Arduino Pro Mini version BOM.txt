Notes:
Item #2:  This is needed only if you don't already have a way to program the Arduino Pro Mini
Item #3:  This is needed only if you don't want to make the Arduino Pro Mini a permanent installation
          in your calculator and you want to reuse it for a later project.
Item #5:  This is needed if you want to permanently attach a means to reprogram the Arduino Pro Mini after it
          has been installed into your calculator.
Item #6:  This can be used in place of Item #5 and wouldn't have to be soldered to teh Arduino Pro Mini.
Item #7 and #8:  These are recommended only if you don't already have some old jumper wires (such as CD-ROM kits or 
          from old computer boards) laying around.
